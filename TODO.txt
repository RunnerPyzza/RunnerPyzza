RPdeamon:
- on bazzilab the github setup sometimes asks for a password on screen
- The user can specify a directory where the script has to be launched
- When the start command has been issued, the daemon should reply with running instead of queued (it happens only when the first step is not ready)
- When a machine is not reachable the deamon should not crash with error "Host unreachable"
